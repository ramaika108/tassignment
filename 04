1) All components will re-render when 'count' is updated. Difficult to maintain and modify this code.
2) Use Context.
   Declare state on the level, where is is actually needed (move 'extraA' and 'extraB' to 'LayerA' and 'LayrerB').
3) The benefit is, no need to pass props through components where they are not needed. The drawback is, it will make the component more difficult to reuse.
   The benefit is, less props drilling. The drawback, Parent component will not be able to modify 'extraA' and 'extraB'.
